/**
 * The ServerManager class manages info about region servers.
 * <p>
 * Maintains lists of online and dead servers.  Processes the startups,
 * shutdowns, and deaths of region servers.
 * <p>
 * Servers are distinguished in two different ways.  A given server has a
 * location, specified by hostname and port, and of which there can only be one
 * online at any given time.  A server instance is specified by the location
 * (hostname and port) as well as the startcode (timestamp from when the server
 * was started).  This is used to differentiate a restarted instance of a given
 * server from the original instance.
 * <p>
 * If a sever is known not to be running any more, it is called dead. The dead
 * server needs to be handled by a ServerShutdownHandler.  If the handler is not
 * enabled yet, the server can't be handled right away so it is queued up.
 * After the handler is enabled, the server will be submitted to a handler to handle.
 * However, the handler may be just partially enabled.  If so,
 * the server cannot be fully processed, and be queued up for further processing.
 * A server is fully processed only after the handler is fully enabled
 * and has completed the handling.
